Mano Machine
============
This project contains the VHDL source code and the final project report
of a 16-bit microprocessor designed during final semester (2005) of
my Bachelor of Technology program.

The microprocessor was designed in a trainer kit containing a Xilinx
CPLD chip. Most of the design, the architecture and the instruction set
were taken from *Computer System Architecture (3rd ed.)* by *M. Morris
Mano.* This project is a practical implementation of what was learnt from
the book. The book has been phenomenol in my life because it has
taught me exactly where the hardware meets the software. This book has
helped me to understand exactly how the hardware fetches, decodes and
executes the software on a physical electronic circuit.

See [report.pdf][R] for details on the Xilinx CPLD kit, the
design, the architecture, the instruction set and the VHDL source code
used to implement the 16-bit microprocessor. The project report was
submitted to the university after the project was completed.
